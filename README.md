# PixiJS Slot Machine TypeScript Conversion
![](./project-preview.png)

This project is a TypeScript conversion of the PixiJS Slot Machine example originally provided in JavaScript on the official PixiJS website: [PixiJS Slot Machine Example](https://pixijs.com/examples/advanced/slots).

## Overview

PixiJS is a powerful 2D rendering engine for the web, and this project demonstrates the creation of a slot machine game using PixiJS. The original code has been adapted and converted from JavaScript to TypeScript for enhanced readability and maintainability.

## Original Source

The original JavaScript code was sourced from the PixiJS examples repository, specifically the [PixiJS Slot Machine example](https://pixijs.com/examples/advanced/slots) available on the PixiJS official website.

## Conversion to TypeScript

The code has been converted to TypeScript, providing static typing to improve code quality and development experience. This conversion enhances the project's maintainability and makes it more accessible for developers who prefer or require TypeScript in their projects.

## Getting Started
